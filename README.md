# Rubik-s-Cube

This is inspired by [Google's ERNO](http://www.17sucai.com/preview/148274/2015-07-02/%E9%AD%94%E6%96%B9/index.html), but want a more flexible way to create cubes.

It will :

* easily to construct a any dimensional Rubik's Cube
* restruct the Model and make it more clear
* create more than one cube in one scene

By now, the Model restruction is finished and have built some methods to run this Model.

I hope we can code the Render together (My Render sucks +_-)
